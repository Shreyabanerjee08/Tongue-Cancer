The features of each node are an aggregation of gene functional data and diverse biological
systems. Three distinct categories of data are considered: gene ontological and functional data,
gene-gene interaction networks, and gene-disease relationships. The gene ontological data also
contains the cell and tissue-specific expression data, all this data is incorporated into the GIN,
which is then used to train the models.
